### Themes

Welcome Theme Developers! There's one thing that all WordPress sites have in common: you need a theme to display a WordPress site. Wirerame helps you work better with a boilerplate starter theme you can use as a framework, or you can also scale the fully-functional child theme for streamlining theme production.

* [Wireframe Theme](https://github.com/mixatheme/wireframe-theme) - An OOP boilerplate theme for using as a framework, parent theme, client project or premium marketplace product.
* [Wireframe Child](https://github.com/mixatheme/wireframe-child) - The boilerplate child theme for products built with Wireframe Theme.
