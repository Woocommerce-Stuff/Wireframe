### Themes

Welcome Theme Developers! There's one thing that all WordPress sites have common: you need a theme to run a WordPress site. Wirerame helps you work better with a boilerplate starter theme you can use as a framework, or you can also scale the fully-functional child theme for streamlining theme production.

* [Wireframe Theme](https://github.com/mixatheme/wp-wireframe-theme) An OOP boilerplate theme for using as a framework, parent theme, client project or premium marketplace products.
* [Wireframe Child](https://github.com/mixatheme/wp-wireframe-child) The boilerplate child theme for Wireframe.

Ah, so you want to develop WordPress plugins? Awesome! We love Plugin Developers because with your creativity, the sky's the limit--and plugins always add more value to any WordPress site. Wireframe provides you with a boilerplate plugin to help speed up development and lower your production costs.

Wireframe objects consist of modular class files which help you rapidly develop your WordPress products while also adhering to OOP best practices, WordPress Coding Standards and GPL licensing. Wireframe makes it easy to keep your code DRY and helps de-couple dependencies. Many of Wireframe's objects can also be shared between themes and plugins. Simply pick an object you wish to use and drop it into your Wireframe theme or plugin!
